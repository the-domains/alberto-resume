I am a business analyst and SharePoint/Nintex developer with a strong foundation of technical and business training reinforced 
with over 8 years of development and project management experience within a variety of industries. I am confident that I can 
leverage my nuanced comprehension of SharePoint technologies to add significant value to an organization like COMPANY. For

experience in producing robust and user-friendly SharePoint sites and pages.

functions, information systems, and database management practices. 
 Considerable expertise in development and support of enterprise-level solutions as well as related security measures and 
documentation practices, with intensive professional experience within multiple North American industries.

end-user requirements, with a proven talent for identifying IT-related process improvement opportunities.
